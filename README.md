On the Monday of the third week of each module, you'll receive a small quiz assessment. This is really just a chance for you to show off how much you've learned, see where you are in terms of grasping the material, and get feedback on ways to improve or areas to focus on!

The first one will cover object relations in Ruby and SQL. Topics will include classes versus instances, variable scope, object relationships, arrays and array methods, and class methods, as well as domain modeling, has_many/belongs_to relationships, SQL select statements, and SQL joins. 

For the first assessment, you'll receive two repos with instructions and deliverables. For example, one deliverable for the first assessment might be "Please implement the methods Pet.all and Pet.find_by_name". It should take you no more than 90 minutes to complete the assessment. It's an open-book, totally Googleable asessment. As opposed to standard Learn labs, there will not be tests. Instead, we will be grading your code holistically, which will enable us to give you more constructive feedback.

You can expect a paragraph of feedback after we grade your assessment that day. Then we'll set aside about 15-20 minutes of time for each of you over the subsequent week to review. 

Future assessments will follow a similar format, but of course, the topics will be different. You can expect any of the topics we cover in class to be touched on in some way. The best way to prepare will be to consistently complete labs, re-read Readmes, and review your lecture notes.
