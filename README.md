# Module Assessments

Late in the second week of each module, you'll receive a coding assessment.
It's  a chance for you to show off how much you've learned, for you and us to
see where you are in terms of grasping the material, and get feedback from us on
ways to improve or areas to work on further!

The first one will cover object relations in Ruby. Topics will include classes
versus instances, variable scope, object relationships, arrays, and array
methods, and class methods, as well as domain modeling, one-to-many, and
many-to-many relationships.

For the first assessment, you'll receive a repo with instructions and
deliverables. For example, one deliverable might be "Please implement the
methods Pet.all and Pet.find_by_name". It's an open-book, totally Googleable
assessment. As opposed to standard labs, there will not be tests. Instead,
we will be reading, running, and grading your code based on how you fulfill the
requirements and your use of coding best practices. We will give you
constructive feedback based on your submission.

You can expect feedback after we grade your assessment. We'll set aside
time for each of you over the subsequent week to review
if you don't pass the assessment.

Future assessments will follow a similar format, but of course, the topics will
be different. You can expect any of the topics we cover in class to be touched
on in some way. The best way to prepare will be to consistently complete labs, 
review your lecture notes, and build your own projects.

Please don't think of passing the assessments as the goal of your learning ——
doing well on them should be a side effect, a by-product of you learning how to
be an amazing developer. By all means, get more practice in any areas where you
know you need it, but don't cram for a code challenge, and definitely don't
sacrifice keeping up with the labs to prepare for it.
